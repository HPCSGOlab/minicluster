Current Verison: Jetpack 36.3/jetson_36.3

This is intended to setup a head node of the cluster automatically. The entire directory structure is used.
Generally, just run setup.sh in this directory. It will attempt to establish networking automatically, but
networking is required for setup to complete. This should only matter if you provide these files offline; otherwise, you would have to set up the network to git clone anyway. 

Fundamentally, these clusters are driven by 4 primary services:
1) DHCP - ip addressing; also drives client-specific configuration using DHCP hooks
2) NFS - shared file system
3) TFTP - allows pxe boot into OS
4) NTP - NFS and other things will not work without this. Clients get time from the head node over ntp.

DHCP does most of the hard work; it creates temporary file system directories for the systems to boot off of
when the client first connects. Changes to client file system layout have to take place in the dhcp hooks.

setup.sh attempts to set up all these services correctly and simultaneously. 
Additionally, we:

1) Use a custom init, to ensure proper mounting
2) use a custome kernel, so we can use NFS 4.

setup.sh does both of these steps automagically; if we want to upgrade the version of jetpack, script modifications must be made.
